## About
This component is designed to properly load environment configuration files and pass it onto the main application kernel so it can be applied to the whole application upon startup. What makes this component so awesome is it can create configuration files for you and write it to certain directory and it contains it's very own parser to automatically process value types based on the array configuration passed to the loader class. We created a static loader and a non-static loader. It is totally up to use which one you want to use. If you want to learn more you can visit the documentaion in the links section.
